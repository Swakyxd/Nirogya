# Frontend-Backend Integration Test Guide

## ✅ Automated Test Results
Both your frontend and backend are running and communicating properly!

**Test Report ID:** `68ba8aad2d009dae90367420`
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend API responding at http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Anonymous report submission working
- ✅ Data being stored in MongoDB

## 🧪 Manual Browser Test

### Step 1: Test the Form Submission
1. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000/get-started**
2. Fill out the form:
   - **Name:** Enter any name (e.g., "Test User")
   - **Symptoms:** Describe how you're feeling (e.g., "Stomach pain and mild fever for 2 days")
3. Click **"Get Personalized Guidance"**
4. You should see:
   - Button changes to "Submitting..."
   - Success message appears: "✅ Thank you! Your information has been submitted successfully."

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any errors (there shouldn't be any)
4. You should see a success log with the report data

### Step 3: Verify Database Storage
1. Log into your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Go to your cluster → Browse Collections
3. Select the `reports` collection
4. Look for your test submission with the name you entered

## 🔧 What's Working
- ✅ **Anonymous Reporting**: Users can submit health reports without registration
- ✅ **Real-time Processing**: Data flows from frontend → backend → MongoDB
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Frontend can communicate with backend API
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Form shows loading states and success/error messages
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Backend properly validates and stores report data

## 📊 API Endpoints Tested
- `GET /api/health` - Backend health check ✅
- `POST /api/reports/anonymous` - Anonymous report submission ✅
- `GET /api/dashboard/reports` - Retrieve reports (requires auth) ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Test with Real Data**: Have team members test the form with real symptoms
2. **Dashboard Integration**: When dashboard is ready, test PHC staff login and view reports
3. **AI Integration**: Use the AI toolkit to extract and analyze submitted data
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test on mobile devices for rural user experience
