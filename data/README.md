## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Make a Prediction (5 seconds):**

```python
from waterborne_disease_predictor import WaterborneDiseasePredic

# Initialize the champion model
predictor = WaterborneDiseasePredic()

# Emergency scenario prediction
emergency = {
    'state': 'Assam',
    'district': 'Kamrup',
    'disease': 'Cholera',
    'year': 2024,
    'month': 7,  # Monsoon season
    'deaths': 3,
    'previous_cases': 25
}

result = predictor.predict(emergency)

print(f"🎯 Predicted Cases: {result['predicted_cases']}")
print(f"⚠️  Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"💡 Action: {result['recommendation']}")
```

### 2. **Run Interactive Examples:**

```bash
python prediction_examples.py
```

### 3. **Start API Server:**

```bash
python api_prediction_service.py
# Server available at: http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. **API Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "state": "Assam",
    "district": "Kamrup", 
    "disease": "Cholera",
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 7,
    "deaths": 3,
    "previous_cases": 25
  }'
```

## 🎯 Real-World Usage Examples

### **Emergency Response Scenario:**
```python
# Critical monsoon outbreak
crisis = {
    'state': 'Assam',
    'district': 'Jorhat',
    'disease': 'Cholera',
    'year': 2024,
    'month': 8,  # Peak monsoon
    'deaths': 5,
    'previous_cases': 45,
    'current_status': 'Under Investigation'
}

result = predictor.predict(crisis)
# Output: "🚨 CRITICAL: 89 predicted cases - Emergency response required!"
```

### **Batch Processing for Multiple Districts:**
```python
scenarios = [
    {'state': 'Assam', 'disease': 'Cholera', 'deaths': 3, 'month': 7},
    {'state': 'Meghalaya', 'disease': 'Dysentery', 'deaths': 1, 'month': 8},
    {'state': 'Tripura', 'disease': 'Typhoid', 'deaths': 2, 'month': 9}
]

results = predictor.batch_predict(scenarios)
# Process multiple predictions instantly
```
