# SIH Data Extraction System - Public Health & Water Quality

## 📋 What This System Does (In Simple Terms)

This is a **comprehensive automated tool** that reads government reports from PDF files and creates organized databases. The system includes two main extractors:

### 🦠 **Disease Outbreak Extractor**
1. **Reads PDF Reports** - Takes government disease outbreak reports in PDF format
2. **Finds Relevant Information** - Looks for outbreaks in Northeast India involving water-related diseases
3. **Extracts Key Data** - Pulls out important details like number of cases, deaths, dates, and locations
4. **Creates Clean Database** - Organizes everything into a spreadsheet format that's easy to analyze

### 💧 **Water Quality Extractor**
1. **Processes Water Quality PDFs** - Reads water quality monitoring reports
2. **Extracts Parameters** - Captures temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, coliform counts, etc.
3. **Handles Missing Data** - Uses advanced algorithms to fill gaps and ensure 100% data completeness
4. **Generates CSV Files** - Creates analysis-ready datasets for water quality assessment
